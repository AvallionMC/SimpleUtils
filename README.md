# GridFoundation
A large tech addon with new ways to generate and process resources.

## Features
- A new energy system: power grids. These are per-player and global.


- Machines and Generators to go along with this energy system


- Machine Upgrades in the form of kits which persist after the block is broken and placed again


- Utility items and tools

Inspiration taken from the mods Extra Utilities and Thermal Expansion.
