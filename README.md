# GridFoundation
A new energy system: power grids. These are per-player, global, and heavily optimized. 

Machines and Generators to go along with power grids, which have multiple tiers and are heavily optimized internally.

Utility items and tools.

Inspiration taken from the mods Extra Utilities and Thermal Expansion.
